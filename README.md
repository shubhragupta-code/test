- Create *gh-pages* branch

  To use Github Pages,we need to create a new branch as **gh-pages**.   
  For this, click on *Branch:master* and type in *gh-pages*. In the dropdown option, click on *Create branch:gh-pages*.   
  If we initially had *gh-pages* branch then it will switch with the *master* branch. but since we do not have that branch it creates it.
